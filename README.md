### Hello random person on the internet,

After some serious and not so serious events, I decided to become a programmer at the age of 41. Will it be a success or a failure? I hope the former...

So far I learned Python, SQL and some html and CSS. 

Currently working on Data Structures and Algorythms. Planning to learn C++, C and JavaScript in the future (haven't decided the order yet).

Feel free to drop a line or two here: etrahnas@gmail.com

And here are some mandatory emojis:
